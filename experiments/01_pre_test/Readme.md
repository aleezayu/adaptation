# Experimental design

The goal of this experiment is to evaluate how much variability there is in the use of modals given different probability distributions for a given event.
That is we want to estimate the distributions `P(modal | theta)`, where `theta` is the probability of an event happening.


## Cover story

An adult and a child walk up to a gumball machine. The container with the gumballs is high up and the contents can only be seen from the top, so the child cannot see what is in the container.
There is a varying distribution of yellow and red gumballs, which is clearly visible to the adult but not the child. The child says "I want a blue gumball."

We ask, how likely is it that the adult would say:

* You'll get one at the first try. (bare)
* You'll probably get one at the first try. (probably)
* You might get one at the first try. (might)
* Maybe you'll get one at the first try. (maybe)
* You could get one at the first try. (could)
* It's possible that you get one at the first try. (possible)


Across trials, we vary the distributions of yellow and red gumballs. Ideally, there will be variability for some of the distributions where one group of participants predominantly uses one modal whereas the other group uses a different modal.
